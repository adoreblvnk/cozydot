## General principles
<!-- https://x.com/MarcosHernanz/status/2083954734487212511 -->
- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- Study how established products solve the problem before designing a solution. Adopt their proven patterns and conventions rather than inventing an approach from scratch.

## Project conventions

- When adapting official documentation or an established implementation, preserve its structure and line order where practical. Make the smallest project-required diff, keep local terminology, cite the source, and explain only non-obvious deviations.
- Treat Cozydot as a safe typed execution layer. Preserve upstream-documented names, values, paths, and identifiers so users can understand, troubleshoot, and maintain installed software from official documentation alone, without depending on Cozydot.
